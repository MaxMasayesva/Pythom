<h1>A little about my dad and why I look up to him</h1>
<p>The person I am interviewing is my dad. He works as a family physician at Marshfield clinic in Minocqua. My Dad likes to spend time with the family and go on vacations. He grew up in Phoenix, Arizona during the 80â€™s and loved the sport of golf. My dad loves to help people out so that is a big reason why he went into the medical field. He is a part of the Hopi tribe and spent time growing up there in his early childhood. </p>
