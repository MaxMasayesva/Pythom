				<h1>Interview</h1>
					<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you think about a fork in the road in your life, what was it and why did you choose that particular path? 
					</p>
					<p><strong>A:</strong>  A drastic change in my life was in my mid-twenties when everyone around me kept asking 'when are you getting 
					married?' A lot of my friends were married in their early-twenties, to which I always served as a bridesmaid or maid of honor to. 
					Given that there were people interested in asking for my hand in marriage, the feelings were not mutual. In 1993, your father
					received a photograph of me from his relative and began writing letters to me. He traveled back to visit me and after about three visits, 
					he proposed. I think that was a pretty big decision in my life. Not only was I getting married, but I would be moving to a completely new 
					country in a different continent. I was uncertain as to what I should expect. I chose the path for a few different reasons, the first reason 
					being that I loved your dad. The second reason is because I saw opportunity. Compared to Vietnam, it seemed like U.S. had job opportunities 
					that would allow not only me, but the rest of my family to have a better life. That's why I decided to immigrate. 
					</p>

					<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Looking back at your life thus far, what are you most proud of? 
					</p>
					<p><strong>A:</strong>  My proudest moments were walking across the stage and graduating. I remember looking at the black graduate 
					gowns with the colorful tassels being inspired to reach that goal on day and I have. My educational path has been a difficult one not only 
					because of language barriers but also having to support and take care our family throughout the journey. When I graduated from MATC in 2006, 
					I was pregnant with your sister and she was born shortly after in June. 
					</p>

					<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was your childhood like? 
					</p>
					<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was hard. Being born during the war, it didn't get to see your grandfather much because he was enlisted in 
					the army. My fondest memories of him were when he would be home and teasing me to go home to my grandparents' house. I would cry 
					uncontrollably and he was calm me down by taking me to the outdoor market to buy cha lua (Vietnamese pork sausage wrapped in banana leaves). 
					I would stop crying because it was my favorite! 
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who is someone that inspired you?</p>
					<p><strong>A:</strong>   My mom or your grandma because she was able to raise us during hard times. She raised us during the war and 
					participated in difficult manual labor to make money to feed us. After the war, we lost a lot of property and were very poor because 
					the new government wanted to relocate and redistribute people and wealth. Your grandma sold street food sweets during the day and at 
					night we wove baskets and sandals to be sold to feed the family. We were all able to go through college and become teachers so I would 
					say she is very capable and inspiring. 
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is a piece of advice that you would give me?</p>
					<p><strong>A:</strong>  Enjoy life. Do the things you want to do and be happy. There's lots of things to explore in the world so every 
					experience is worth it. When you have the opportunity to travel, take it - you learn so much by going places and experiencing the things 
					around you. You also are able to meet cool people who will help you along the way or become your best friend. When you're ready to settle 
					down, find someone who will truly love and cherish you but also be willing to bear hardships with you. I had a lot of support from your 
					father to graduate and work. He also helped maintain the family by taking care of you and your sister. Make sure that you are doing the 
					things in life that you want to do.
