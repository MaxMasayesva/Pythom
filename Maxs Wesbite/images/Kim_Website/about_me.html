				<h1> About Me & Why I Admire Her</h1>
		<p>My name is Kim Chung and I am currently a fourth-year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a 
		Neurobiology major degree with a certificate in Asian American Studies. During my time at the university, I have been 
		able to adequately balance my roles in student organizations, academics, and work. Following my academic career, I aspire 
		to work in the medical industry while giving back the communities that have provided to my success. My hobbies include exploring 
		other cities in search of yummy foods and being head chef in my household. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I would say that I am a very privileged person - I was born in the U.S. and I have had very fortunate upbringings. 
		There was always food on the table; I had new clothes to wear as need; I was able to participate in summer camps, 
		sports, and other recreationally learning activities; I had support from both of my parents. What I admire most 
		about my mom is her ability juggle multiple tasks with phenomenal execution. For example, why she was in college 
		at MATC, she worked during the day and would take me to her night classes where I would do homework while she was 
		in lectures. After she got me ready for bed at night, she was stay up until midnight studying until my dad comes 
		home from work and day-after-day she did this until she graduated. He academic path is a very inspiring one because not
		only did she have a language barrier upon her arrival to the U.S., she had to care for her family as well. 
		</p>
		<p>Because my mom has worked so hard for everything that she has, it really inspires me to really take advantage of my 
		resources. In college, I have been an active member in Vietnamese organizations to retain my cultural identity. In my academic pursuit, 
		I bare in mind that anything can happen with the time and effort I put in. With a couple of semesters until graduation, 
		I will soon be able to say, "Mama, I did it!"
