				<p>Mrs. Thuha Dang is currently working as a Senior Advisor at Madison Area Technical College (MATC), Truax. Everyday she interacts with many, many students providing them on career, financial, and professional advising to successfully transfer through the Liberal Arts Transfer Program to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where they will graduate with a bachelor’s degree. She has been working here for over ten years since before her graduation from MATC in 2006 with completed degrees in computer science and liberal arts.

				Mrs. Dang immigrated to Madison in 1994 after two long years of filed petitions that would allow her to leave Saigon, Vietnam. Originally on a fiance visa, she married her now-spouse shortly after arriving to the United States and had a baby girl a year later. That baby girl was me!

				The person I chose for this website is my mom because growing up, she’s been the person I looked up to the most because she found a place for herself in America and has always been in pursuit of the ideal ‘American Dream’. Growing up in South Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War, my mom’s life was defined by hardship. Although she grew up in the city and never saw the war happen, it was after the war that life dramatically changed. My grandfather died in during the war and was later ostracized because of his allegiance to the United States leaving my grandmother to raise my mom and her four other siblings by herself. While in Vietnam, my mom was able to obtain good education and eventually became a kindergarten teacher. Eventually, my dad was to meet my mom through a photograph sent by a relative and travel to Vietnam before proposing and bringing my mom to the U.S.
