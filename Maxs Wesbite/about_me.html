				<h1> About Me & Why I Chose my leader</h1>
		<p> I am Max Masayesva and I live in Minocqua, Wisconsin. I aspire to finish high school very strong academically 
		and athletically and move on to a four-year institution. I enjoy sports, video games and being with my good friends. 
		I chose my dad, Brett Masayesva as a leader since he does a lot for the people in my community and he helps with my 
		goals by pushing me to be the best I can be.
		</p>
	
		<p>The person I am interviewing is my dad. He works as a family physician at Marshfield clinic in Minocqua. My Dad likes 
		to spend time with the family and go on vacations. He grew up in Phoenix, Arizona during the 80’s and loved the sport of golf. 
		My dad loves to help people out so that is a big reason why he went into the medical field. He is a part of the Hopi tribe and 
		spent time growing up there in his early childhood.
