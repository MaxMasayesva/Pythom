This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a= (2 == 2)
print(a)


#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c=2   b=2
a= (c == 2)
print(a)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c= 2   b= 3
a= (b > c)
print(a)
#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c= 2 b= 3
a= (c < b)
print(a)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c= 2     b= 3
a= (b >= c)
print(a)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x= 5   y=5
h= (x <= y)
print(h)
#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
a= (2 == 2)
prnt(a)
