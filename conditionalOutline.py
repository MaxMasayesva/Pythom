#1) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if statement, and if a is more than
#5, print out "a is more than 5."
= If
a = 9
 if a>5:
    print("a is more than 5")



#2) Make a boolean variable named b. Now make an if statement, and if b is True
#print out "b is True."
= If
b = "I like dogs
x = True
if x:
    print("b is true")


#3) Make an int variable named c. Now make an if/elif statement, and if c is 
#more than 0, print "c is positive". Else if c is less than 0, print "c is
#negative".
= if
b = "I like dogs"
x = True
if x:
    print("b is true")
    


#4) Make an int variable named d. Now make an if/elif/else statement, and if 
#d is more than 0, print "d is positive". Else if d is less than 0, print "c is
#negative". Else, print "d is zero".
= if, else
c = -1
if c > 0
print("c is positive"



#5) Make an if statement with any comparison, with a common SYNTAX error.
= If
x= 6
if s > 2
print ("more than 2")
