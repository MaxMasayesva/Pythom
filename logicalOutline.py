#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
true = 1
false = two
a= true and false
print(a)
#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.
1 = one
2 = two
b= 1 or 2
print (b)


#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.
c= not 3 == 4
print (c)

#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

one = true
two =  False
a= tue and False
print (A)
