#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x= "Max" + "Masayesva"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var1=10  var2=10
x= "var1" + "var2"

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var1=2   var2=3
x= "var1" - "var2"


#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.


#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
z=2  y=4
x= "z" * "y"


#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
x= "good" * "Morning"


#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
f= 5  g=7
x= "f" / "g"

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
float(7)
x= "float" / "float"

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
h=6  u=8
x= "h" % "u"

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
n= 3   c= 9
x= "n" // "c"

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
Var3= 9   Var4= 6
x= "Var3" ** "Var4"
#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
x= "Max" =+Masayesva"
pint(x
