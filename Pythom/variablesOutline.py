#string, boolean and list)
#integer
a=5
a=4

#float

a=3.45
a=4.25

#string

a= "max"

#boolean

a=True

a=False

#list

a=[1, 2, 3, 4]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

VarA= 1
Vara= 2

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
var=4
var= "string"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
varTwo=var


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

2= [1, 2, 3]


#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

m= "max"

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:
varTwo= var
print(varTwo)



#8)
